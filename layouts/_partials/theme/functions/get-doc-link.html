Returns the versioned documentation link according to the current page version.

For example, the link `docs/guides/requirements/` will be returned as:
- `docs/guides/requirements/` for the main documentation;
- `docs/1/guides/requirements/` for the documentation version 1;
- and so on.

Adds the current version path only for links starting from `docs/...`.
